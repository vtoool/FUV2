# Agent Guidelines

- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`, and keep existing semicolon usage.
- Prefer small helper functions over inlining complex logic to keep `app.js` readable.
- Follow the surrounding indentation style (two spaces in JavaScript files).
- Update related UI state helpers when changing agenda sorting logic.
